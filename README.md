# EcoHome Energy Advisor

An AI-powered energy optimization agent that helps customers reduce electricity costs and environmental impact through personalized recommendations.

## Project Overview

EcoHome is a smart-home energy start-up that helps customers with solar panels, electric vehicles, and smart thermostats optimize their energy usage. The Energy Advisor agent provides personalized recommendations about when to run devices to minimize costs and carbon footprint.

### Key Features

- **Weather Integration**: Uses weather forecasts to predict solar generation
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Considers time-of-day electricity prices for cost optimization
- **Historical Analysis**: Queries past energy usage patterns for personalized advice
- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieves relevant energy-saving tips and best practices
- **Multi-device Optimization**: Handles EVs, HVAC, appliances, and solar systems
- **Cost Calculations**: Provides specific savings estimates and ROI analysis

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
VOCAREUM_API_KEY=your_vocareum_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run the Notebooks

Execute the notebooks in order:

1. **01_db_setup.ipynb** - Set up the database and populate with sample data
2. **02_rag_setup.ipynb** - Configure the RAG pipeline for energy tips
3. **03_run_and_evaluate.ipynb** - Test and evaluate the agent

## Agent Capabilities

### Tools Available

- **Weather Forecast**: Get hourly weather predictions and solar irradiance
- **Electricity Pricing**: Access time-of-day pricing data
- **Energy Usage Query**: Retrieve historical consumption data
- **Solar Generation Query**: Get past solar production data
- **Energy Tips Search**: Find relevant energy-saving recommendations
- **Savings Calculator**: Compute potential cost savings

### Example Questions

The Energy Advisor can answer questions like:

- "When should I charge my electric car tomorrow to minimize cost and maximize solar power?"
- "What temperature should I set my thermostat on Wednesday afternoon if electricity prices spike?"
- "Suggest three ways I can reduce energy use based on my usage history."
- "How much can I save by running my dishwasher during off-peak hours?"

## Database Schema

### Energy Usage Table
- `timestamp`: When the energy was consumed
- `consumption_kwh`: Amount of energy used
- `device_type`: Type of device (EV, HVAC, appliance)
- `device_name`: Specific device name
- `cost_usd`: Cost at time of usage

### Solar Generation Table
- `timestamp`: When the energy was generated
- `generation_kwh`: Amount of solar energy produced
- `weather_condition`: Weather during generation
- `temperature_c`: Temperature at time of generation
- `solar_irradiance`: Solar irradiance level

## Learning Objectives

This project helps students learn:

1. **Database Design**: Creating schemas for energy management systems
2. **API Integration**: Working with external weather and pricing APIs
3. **RAG Implementation**: Building retrieval-augmented generation pipelines
4. **Agent Development**: Creating intelligent agents with tool usage
5. **Evaluation Methods**: Testing and measuring agent performance
6. **Energy Optimization**: Understanding smart home energy management

## Key Technologies
